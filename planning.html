		  <h1>10 Steps in Hospital Planning - Projects to "Go Live"</h1>
          
        <p>If there was a checklist which would need to be followed to build a hospital, what would it include? Here are my essential top 10 steps based on experience</p>.

 <p>1. Identify your mission, vision and objectives - Allows for greater clarity on market segment addressed, beds to be commissioned, geography, and technology.</p>

 <p>2. Get on board 3 people - One from Finance, One Physician Leader and a CEO. Hire the Right Leaders. Have a primary business plan and draw up the project charter.</p>

 <p>3. Plan the Clinical Program - Based on the vision and objectives as well as disease profiling, decide on how much you will invest on technology in each specialty. Identify the patient flow.</p>

 <p>4. Primary discussion with contractors - Plan the box. Develop the stacking plan. Understand the floor plan details. Re-work patient flow and identify storage areas.</p>

 <p>5. Bring your Medical Equipment Vendors In - Have primary discussions with your medical and non-medical equipment vendors and re-look at the floor plans. Make changes wherever required. Understand the engineering requirements including HVAC, power, water supply and drainage. Plan your internal transport mechanisms for people and goods.</p>

 <p>6. Start your IT Discussions as your start building the box - CIO steps in. Decide on what system you want, have discussions with clinical fraternity and map the requirements. Choose your system. Identify any help required with server locations and map the network proposed.</p>

 <p>7. Build your RDS - Elaborate your plans in form of room data sheets and understand the nitty gritties of the building.</p>

 <p>8. Work on HMIS, Staffing and Workflows - Bring in clinicians, managers and plan the staffing. Understand the HMIS and identify the points of access (front office/ kiosks/ clinical workstations/Building Management System/Security and access controls). Define the analytics which will form backbone of your hospital. Map analytics with the business plan.</p>

 <p>9. Equipment Installation, Training and Dry Runs - Form teams to undertake rounds, ensure that room data sheets match with the structure delivered. Install equipment and check the HVAC to confirm environmental conditions are optimal and sustained for smooth operations. Complete the infection control protocol. Commission your OT. Train your staff for use of equipment. Evaluate all your mock runs.</p>

 <p>10. Trials and "Go Live" - Try out your HMIS, fix major bugs and test your processes on dummy patients. Ensure the equipment interfacing is complete. Stick to your schedules, evaluate MIS reports and make any corrections required (minor). Get at least a week of runs with a decent workload with minimal errors and you should be "good to go"</p>.
