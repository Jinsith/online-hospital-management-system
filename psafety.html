		  <h1>What is Patient Safety?"</h1>
	<p>When we talk about patient safety, we’re really talking about how hospitals and other health care organizations protect their patients from errors, injuries, accidents, and infections. While many hospitals are good at keeping their patients safe, some hospitals aren’t. As many as 440,000 people die every year from preventable errors in hospitals. It’s up to everyone to make sure that patient safety is the number one priority at every hospital across the United States. Some hospitals have hidden dangers, but there are things you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones.</p>
	
	
	 <h1>What is Patient Safety?"</h1>
	<p>In some hospitals, patient safety is a top priority. Strong health care teams reduce infection rates, put checks in place to prevent mistakes, and ensure strong lines of communication between hospital staff, patients, and families.</p>
	<p>But some hospitals don’t have teams that work well together, or good leadership to ensure that patient safety is the number one priority. When one person makes a mistake, there isn’t a good team ready to catch that mistake. Patients can experience dangerous complications, recovery is slower, and some patients even die unnecessarily.</p>
	<p>For example, an air or gas bubble in the blood (air embolism) is a serious medical error. An air or gas bubble stops blood from flowing through the body. This serious mistake can happen during surgery or other procedures. If blood flow is blocked, a patient can suffer a stroke or die.</p>
	<p>Many hospitals in this country have safety records that wouldn’t be tolerated in any other industry. The statistics are alarming:</p>
	<p>As many as 440,000 people die every year from hospital errors, injuries, accidents, and infections<p>
<p>Every year, 1 out of every 25 patients develops an infection while in the hospital—an infection that didn’t have to happen.</p>
<p>A Medicare patient has a 1 in 4 chance of experiencing injury, harm or death when admitted to a hospital</p>
<p>Today alone, more than 1000 people will die because of a preventable hospital error</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that most hospital errors can be prevented. Hospitals need to work hard every day to protect their patients from errors, injuries, accidents, and infections.</p>
	
	
	 <h1>Why the Hospital Safety Score Works</h1>
	 <p>One of the most significant problems with today’s health care system is the failure to make safety and quality information available to the public. But the public deserves this information so they can make informed choices about where to receive care. The purpose of the Hospital Safety Score is to bring this information to light in a way that is easy for you – the consumer – to use.

	      <p>Some people do more research on what car to buy than what hospital to go to for medical care. The Hospital Safety Score provides data and research to help you make informed decisions about a critical aspect of your hospital stay – safety. A hospital may have the best surgeons and greatest technology in the world, but unless it is preventing infections and eliminating errors, it is not delivering on a very basic premise: ensuring the safety of you and your loved ones. The goal of the Hospital Safety Score is to reduce the approximately 440,000 yearly deaths from hospital errors and injuries by publicly recognizing safety and exposing harm.

The Hospital Safety Score’s letter grade scoring system allows consumers to quickly assess the safety of their local hospital, and choose the safest hospital to seek care. As consumers use the Hospital Safety Score more and more, we hope more hospitals will be compelled to be open about their safety and quality, and participate in meaningful public reporting.</p>
